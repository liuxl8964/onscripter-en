# onscripter-en

Another fork of onscripter-en by [Mion](http://unclemion.com/onscripter/releases/) for modern macOS (have been tested on macOS 10.12 and 10.13). It includes:

- a SDL version bump (from 1.2.13 to 1.2.15)
- a SDL_mixer version bump (from 1.2.8 to 1.2.12)
- updates to the Xcode project file to build the project against latest SDK

I started this fork when I had problems with latest Mion's build on some games; for example, a black-screen problem on [Rose Guns Days](http://witch-hunt.com/stage_rgd_demo.html).

Forked from the file [onscripter-en-20110628-fullsrc.tar.bz2](http://unclemion.com/onscripter/pub/onscr/onscripter-en-20110628-fullsrc.tar.bz2).
